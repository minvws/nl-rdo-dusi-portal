# Application API

## Install

After creating a local git checkout of this repository, getting this project up
and running is a matter of:

Running the run.sh script

### TL;DR

If you already know how all of this works, this should be all the information
you need:

```sh
# 1. Start the applications
./run.sh -c -i -m

# 2. Connect to assessment-portal
By default the portal is accessable at http://localhost:8000
```
